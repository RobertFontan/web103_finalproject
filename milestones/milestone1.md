## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?


[Rob - What went well was organizing it, considering we are in
two different time zones, we made a schedule where we can meet up and work. We're on the same page with the app we want to build, and we're both excited to work on it. We also have a good idea of what we want to do for our custom features.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[Rob - Challenges include finding a good project name, and pinpointing what features out app would have. ]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[Rob - Additional support could be to have a "best practices" towards building an app between people. Other than that I think we're good.]
